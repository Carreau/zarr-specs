Zarr core protocol version 3.0
==============================


Conceptual model
----------------

A Zarr *hierarchy* is a tree structure, where each node in the tree is
either a *group* or an *array*. Group nodes may have children
but array nodes may not.

Each node in a hierarchy has a *name* which is a string of ASCII
characters with some additional constraints. Two sibling nodes cannot 
have the same name. The root node does not have a name.

Each node in a hierarchy has a *path* which uniquely identifies that
node and defines its location within the hierarchy. The path is formed 
by joining together the "/" character, followed by the names of all 
ancestor nodes separated by the "/" character, followed by the name of 
the node itself. For example, the path "/foo/bar" identifies a node 
named "bar", whose parent is named "foo", whose parent is the root of 
the hierarchy. The string "/" identifies the root node.

An array has a fixed number of zero or more *dimensions*. Each dimension has an
integer length. The core protocol only considers the case where the
lengths of all dimensions are finite. However, protocol extensions may
be defined which allow a dimension to have infinite or variable
length.

The *shape* of an array is the tuple of dimension lengths. For
example, if an array has 2 dimensions, where the length of the first
dimension is 100 and the length of the second dimension is 20, then
the shape of the array is (100, 20).

An array contains zero or more *elements*. Each element can be
identified by a tuple of coordinates, one for each dimension of the
array. If all dimensions of an array have finite length, then the
number of elements in the array is given by the product of the
dimension lengths. An array element may be empty, or it may have a
value.

An array is associated with a *data type*. A data type defines the set
of possible values that the array may contain, and a binary
representation (i.e., sequence of bytes) for each possible value. For
example, the little-endian 32-bit signed integer data type defines
binary representations for all integers in the range âˆ’2,147,483,648 to
2,147,483,647. The core protocol only considers a limited set of data
types, but protocol extensions may define other data types.

An array is divided into a set of *chunks*, where each chunk is a
hyperrectangle defined by a tuple of intervals, one for each dimension
of the array. The shape of a chunk is the tuple of interval lengths,
and the size of a chunk (i.e., number of elements contained within the
chunk) is the product of its interval lengths.

The chunks of an array are organised into a *grid*. The core protocol
only considers the case where all chunks have the same shape and the
chunks form a regular grid. However, protocol extensions may define
other grid types such as rectilinear grids.

An array is associated with a *memory layout* which defines how to
construct a binary representation of a single chunk by organising the
binary values within the chunk into a single contiguous sequence of
bytes. The core protocol defines two types of memory layout based on
"C" (row-major) and "F" (column-major) ordering of values, but
protocol extensions may define other memory layouts.

An array is associated with an *encoding pipeline*, which is a
sequence of zero or more *codecs* that transforms the binary
representation of a chunk in some way. For example, an encoding
pipeline might include a checksum codec to ensure data integrity, and
a compression codec to reduce data size. All codecs implement a common
*codec interface* which provides a pair of operations, one to perform
the transformation (encode), the other to reverse the transformation
(decode).

Each node in a hierarchy is represented by a *metadata document*,
which is a machine-readable document containing essential processing
information about the node. For example, an array metadata document
will specify the number of dimensions, length of each dimension, data
type, chunk shape, memory layout and encoding pipeline for that array.

Each node in a hierarchy may have an *attributes document*, which is a
machine-readable document containing information that may be useful to
users of the data but is not essential to the basic processing of the
node.

The metadata, attributes and encoded chunk data for all nodes in a
hierarchy are held in a *store*. To enable a variety of different
store types to be used, the core protocol defines a simple *store
interface* which is a common set of operations that a store must
provide.

Codecs
------

An array may be configured with a chunk encoding pipeline, which is a
sequence of zero or more codecs used to transform the binary
representation of each chunk prior to storage, and to reverse the
transformation during retrieval.

A codec is defined as a pair of algorithms named *encode* and
*decode*. Both of these algorithms transform a sequence of bytes
(input) into another sequence of bytes (output). The *decode*
algorithm is the reverse of the *encode* algorithm, but it is not
required that the reversal is perfect. For example, a codec may be a
lossy compressor for floating point data, which will lose some
numerical precision during encoding and thus not reproduce exactly the
original byte sequence after subsequent decoding. However, if *a* is
the binary representation of a chunk with data type *d* and internal
memory layout *m*, then the result *b = decode(encode(a))* must be
consistent with the data type and memory layout of *a*.

To allow for flexibility to define and implement new codecs, this
specification does not define any codecs, nor restrict the set of
codecs that may be used. Each codec must be defined via a separate
specification. In order to refer to codecs in array metadata
documents, each codec must have a unique identifier, which is a URI
that dereferences to a human-readable specification of the codec. A
codec specification must declare the codec identifier, and describe
(or cite documents that describe) the encoding and decoding algorithms
and the format of the encoded data.

A codec may have configuration parameters which modify the behaviour
of the codec in some way. For example, a compression codec may have a
compression level parameter, which is an integer that affects the
resulting compression ratio of the data. Configuration parameters must
be declared in the codec specification, including a definition of how
configuration parameters are represented as JSON.

The Zarr core development team maintains a repository of codec
specifications, which are hosted alongside this specification in the
`zarr-specs GitHub repository
<https://github.org/zarr-developers/zarr-specs>`_, and which are
published on the `zarr-specs documentation Web site
<http://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/>`_. For ease of discovery, it is
recommended that codec specifications are contributed to the
zarr-specs GitHub repository. However, codec specifications may be
maintained by any group or organisation and published in any location
on the Web. For further details of the process for contributing a
codec specification to the zarr-specs GitHub repository, see the Zarr
community process specification @@TODO link.
