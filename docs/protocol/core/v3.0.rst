Zarr core protocol version 3.0
==============================

Conceptual model
----------------

A Zarr *hierarchy* is a tree structure, where each node in the tree is
either a *group* or an *array*. Group nodes may have children
but array nodes may not.

Each node in a hierarchy has a *name* which is a string of ASCII
characters with some additional constraints (see below). Two sibling
nodes cannot have the same name. The root node does not have a
name.

Each node in a hierarchy has a *path* which uniquely identifies that
node and defines its location within the hierarchy. The path is formed 
by joining together the "/" character, followed by the names of all 
ancestor nodes separated by the "/" character, followed by the name of 
the node itself. For example, the path "/foo/bar" identifies a node 
named "bar", whose parent is named "foo", whose parent is the root of 
the hierarchy. The string "/" identifies the root node.

An array has a fixed number of *dimensions*. Each dimension has an
integer length. The core protocol only considers the case where the
lengths of all dimensions are finite. However, protocol extensions may
be defined which allow a dimension to have infinite or variable
length.

The *shape* of an array is the tuple of dimension lengths. For
example, if an array has 2 dimensions, where the length of the first
dimension is 100 and the length of the second dimension is 20, then
the shape of the array is (100, 20).

An array contains zero or more *elements*. Each element can be
identified by a tuple of coordinates, one for each dimension of the
array. If all dimensions of an array have finite length, then the
number of elements in the array is given by the product of the
dimension lengths. An array element may be empty, or it may have a
value.

An array is associated with a *data type*. A data type defines the set
of possible values that the array may contain, and a binary
representation (i.e., sequence of bytes) for each possible value. For
example, the little-endian 32-bit signed integer data type defines
binary representations for all integers in the range âˆ’2,147,483,648 to
2,147,483,647. The core protocol only considers a limited set of data
types, but protocol extensions may define other data types.

An array is divided into a set of *chunks*, where each chunk is a
hyperrectangle defined by a tuple of intervals, one for each dimension
of the array. The shape of a chunk is the tuple of interval lengths,
and the size of a chunk (i.e., number of elements contained within the
chunk) is the product of its interval lengths.

The chunks of an array are organised into a *grid*. The core protocol
only considers the case where all chunks have the same shape and the
chunks form a regular grid. However, protocol extensions may define
other grid types such as rectilinear grids.

An array is associated with a *memory layout* which defines how to
construct a binary representation of a single chunk by organising the
binary values within the chunk into a single contiguous sequence of
bytes. The core protocol defines two types of memory layout based on
"C" (row-major) and "F" (column-major) ordering of values, but
protocol extensions may define other memory layouts.

An array is associated with an *encoding pipeline*, which is a
sequence of zero or more *codecs* that transforms the binary
representation of a chunk in some way. For example, an encoding
pipeline might include a checksum codec to ensure data integrity, and
a compression codec to reduce data size. All codecs implement a common
*codec interface* which provides a pair of operations, one to perform
the transformation (encode), the other to reverse the transformation
(decode).

Each node in a hierarchy is represented by a *metadata document*,
which is a machine-readable document containing essential processing
information about the node. For example, an array metadata document
will specify the number of dimensions, length of each dimension, data
type, chunk shape, memory layout and encoding pipeline for that array.

Each node in a hierarchy may have an *attributes document*, which is a
machine-readable document containing information that may be useful to
users of the data but is not essential to the basic processing of the
node.

The metadata, attributes and encoded chunk data for all nodes in a
hierarchy are held in a *store*. To enable a variety of different
store types to be used, the core protocol defines a simple *store
interface* which is a common set of operations that a store must
provide.
